## Overview

**Loneline** is inspired by empirical research and expert advice:
- **Group Barkley Experiment & Related Studies**: Our approach is supported by various studies showing the positive effects of social support and peer interaction on mental health. Notable references include:
  - Cohen, S. & Wills, T. A. (1985). *Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis*.
  - Holt-Lunstad, J., Smith, T. B. & Layton, J. B. (2010). *Social relationships and mortality risk: a meta-analytic review*.
  - Dennis, C. L. (2003). *Peer support within a health care context: a concept analysis*.
- **Doctor DABOUL's Advice**: Based on clinical experience, Doctor DABOUL emphasizes that people tend to improve when they receive social support. This project is a practical step towards implementing that principle.

The chatbot works by engaging you in conversation to:
1. **Help reduce loneliness** through supportive dialogue.
2. **Determine your MBTI type** after several exchanges.
3. **Adapt its conversational style** to match your MBTI type, ensuring that you interact with a personality that is most compatible with yours.

  - **Thematic Moderation**: In addition to common moderation practices, our system monitors and restricts conversations on pre-defined sensitive topics.
